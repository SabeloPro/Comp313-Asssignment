# Comp313-Asssignment

A local town has a cinema complex with a single silver screen theatre that can seat 72 customers. There
is a ticket sales cashier where patrons can buy or collect their tickets, which they do upon entering the
cinema. If 72 tickets have been sold, the cashier will tell patrons to go away and come back for the next
show; otherwise, the patron pays and the cashier gives them a ticket.
Once patrons have a ticket, they have a choice to use the toilet or visit the snack bar before they go into
the theatre.
The toilet is unisex, and there is only one cubicle. The snack bar is attended by two cashiers, but there is
a single queue. The theatre is administrated by two ushers, who collect tickets and make sure the
patrons take their allocated seats. After the show, patrons leave the cinema.
Extra Marks: Occasionally, a patron may need the toilet during the show â€“ model this with a 5%
probability.
Question
Model the above synchronization problem in pseudo-code as FIVE processes:
1. Ticket sales cashier
2. Snackbar cashier
3. Usher
4. Patron
Use semaphores and shared memory to model shared resources, and synchronized access to them.
(Hint: the Barbershop problem will be most helpful as a pattern to guide your design)
(Hint: you can use the techniques from prac 4 to model your solution for testing purposes)
Submit your PSEUDOCODE solution with code comments to the moodle site when complete.
